## Description

This is a basic stock trading simulator orginally as the week 9 assignment of the Harvard CS50 course. I have deployed the web app to a Heroku dyno so you may access a live demo.

## Usage

1. Press "Register" on the navigation bar to create an account
2. You will receive US$ 10,000 simulation cash by default

- Quote: shows the price after inputing a US stock symbol
- Buy: input a US stock symbol with the amount of shares you want to buy
- Sell: choose from drop down menu the stocks you own and input the amount of shares you want to sell
- History: a list of all transactions you have made
- Add Cash: add more simulation cash



## Disclaimers

- This app is running on a free infrastructure and plans, so it will take some time (like 30sec or so) for the server to spin up.
- You will be able to register an account and test all of the site's features but your data will not be stored for more than a day.
- Don't use the same password that you would use in real-life to register, as I have not implemented a whole lot of security features in this toy app.
- This site draws real-time US market data from an API so please do not abuse the requests.
